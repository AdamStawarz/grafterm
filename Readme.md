# Grafterm

Grafterm is an application to load dashboards on the terminal, you could think of grafterm as a simplified version of [Grafana] but for terminal.

## Features

- Multiple widgets (graph, singlestat, gauge).
- Multiple datasources usage (including aggregation).
- Extensible metrics implementation (Prometheus included).
- Templating of variables.
- Auto time interval adjustment for queries.
- Fixed and adaptive grid.
- Color customization on widgets.
- Configurable sutorefresh.
- Single binary and easy usage/deployment.

## Kudos

This project would not be possible without the effort of many people and projects but specially [Grafana] for the inspiration, ideas and the project itself, and [Termdash] for the rendering of all those fancy graphs on the terminal.
